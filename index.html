            Math is very fun because it tests logic. Math includes different formulas and challenges, and I love to solve them. I use Khan Academy, IXL, and many other math websites to learn math. Math can also lead you to do experiments nobody has ever done before. Math can create innovative ideas, and before you know it, you will be loving math! Math is important to learn because it builds problem-solving skills. I also try to solve math problems mentally. Every person needs to know how to think through problems. Math can help with reasoning, creativity, and thinking. Math is a very good curriculum skill, too. Math always keeps a person busy and ready to solve a challenge. Math is an amazing, fun, challenging, and experimental subject. I love math!
